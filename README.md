# Data_analitics
I am an accomplished specialist in the project management field, design of equipment and development of technological processes in the atomic, oil, gas and chemical fields.
Participated in the development and testing prototypes for the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.
Took part in the development of prototype equipment for the oil and gas field.
Responsible for the modification and improvement of the line of cement equipment (cement trucks).
Conducted such direction as the design of technological oil and gas blocks.
Thanks to the desire to structure information, in a short time I can sort out new areas and technologies for the production of equipment and products. 
Well proven in working with non-standard equipment and in situations of parallel work on several objects. Always stick to the timing of the design.
In addition, I was teaching 3D modeling in the education center (SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor) and wrote curriculums for students.
Have taken Data analytics courses.
